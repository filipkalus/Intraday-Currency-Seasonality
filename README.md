Currency markets are very popular among speculators (as they allow speculators to employ substantial leverage), but their main purpose is to serve exporting/importing companies to exchange different currencies. As companies are located in different timezones, this mismatch in a time of a real demand causes small intraday price trends in a lot of the currency pairs. Transaction costs in currency markets are very low; therefore, even this small edge could be profitably exploited. We present an academic paper which explores this intraday pattern in EUR/USD currency pair and presents simple but profitable EUR/USD seasonal trading strategy.

Fundamental reason
The academic paper states that the exporters, being large traders in the foreign exchange market, induce systematic pattern in the intraday dynamics of exchange rates. The currency market is segmented in the time dimension: When the American exporters are trading in their business hours, the European exporters are sleeping. Due to the segmentation of business hours, exporters face insufficient interest from the buying side. They thus need the help of financial intermediaries to transfer the currencies from day to night. The intermediaries require a risk premium for being exposed to the exchange rate risk, so foreign currencies appreciate during home business hours.

Simple trading strategy
The investment universe consists of EUR/USD currency pair. Each day, the investor goes short EUR/USD during EU business hours (from 8 AM to 4 PM at London time) and goes long EUR/USD during US business hours (from 4 PM London time to 5 PM New York time) and respectively. Transaction bid/ask spread is assumed 1pip and is deducted from the presented performance.
